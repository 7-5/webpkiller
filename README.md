# Introducing Webp Killer
you download an image from the internet for your creative thingies and the app you work with doesnt support .webp file. you werent aware you downloaded a .webp file, and you check to see that you did. **OR** you use old windows photo gallery and the .webp files appear much darker for some reason. you are able to change one image with arduous efforts to a .png file, but you realise your gallery is FILLED with these. your long collected memes, funnies, ALL REDUCED TO AN INFERIOR FORM OF .webp. you frantically google for online converters, they only convert few, heck, even maybe with a paywall or daily limit. you stumble upon an app that could solve all pain, but you hardly could remove after seeing that the completely free guarantee was all just a big lie, it still has some roots your axe couldn't reach. you are voltaing around the room, this is no good, a diabolical file format, went unnoticed, collective deviation, panic inducing, spawn of evil, restriction of mobility, heavy breathing, air is filled with a stinging smell, vision blackens, heartbeats fade. this is the curse of the .webp file format. 

this project was coded on top of a gpt prompt. prompted by me to solve such a mind boggling problem, i should be pausing posting my own work for a while to show you how i dealt with such a pain. 

i personally refuse calling ai's work mine, its an amalgamation of github users' code. however, for makeshift solutions for personal use, i will consider help of AI as an older sibling's. another thing, ai chatting is super good and informative, its something like google 2 in a sense to me. i wish people used it not to cheese thru exams but have it as a one to one study session with a teacher.

enough yapping

# How to install
- you first need python. go get it from https://www.python.org/ it runs lots of stuff and is a cool thing to learn i highly encourage.
- then you need to install PIL. for that, in windows, press windows button, type cmd (command prompt should pop out), click "open as administrator" on the right panel. type **pip install pillow**
- goto C drive
- create folder called **webpkiller**
- in that create two folders, namely named **webp**, **png**, respectively.
- put **webpkiller.py** in **webpkiller** folder.
- enjoy!

# Usage
- put your dissonant .webp files in the **webp** folder.
- run the python file, wait for it to close by itself.
- delete the contents of **webp** folder with auspicious abatement and pride, good riddance!
- rejoice at the arrival of cadent .png files, lodging triumphantly in **png** folder!
- note that this will turn gif-like webp files to .png format.
